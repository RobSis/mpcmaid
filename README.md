MPC Maid is a software editor for the Akai MPC 1000, MPC 2500, and MPC 500, for Mac, PC, and other platforms (Java) 

- Switch between the MPC 500 12-pads layout or the MPC 1000 16-pads layout (also takes care of the correct number of filters and sliders thanks to the built-in machine profiles).

- Simply drag and drop your samples files onto the pads, and it automatically assigns them, one on each pad or one on each sample layer.

- Export the full program and every related sample file together to the target location of your choice.

- Also features a semi-automatic slicing tool: drop your loop file to have it chopped into slices based on a beat detection mechanism.

- Direct export of the chopped slices as multiple .WAV files, one corresponding .PGM program file and one MIDI groove .MID file.

- Multiple window, one window for one program, simply drag and drop a .PGM program file will open a new window for this program.


# Installation

Download the unique .jar directly from [Github](https://github.com/RobSis/mpcmaid/blob/master/MpcMaid/mpcmaid_beta.jar)

You can also download [EXE-wrapped jar](https://github.com/RobSis/mpcmaid/blob/master/MpcMaid/mpcmaid_beta.exe). Note that you still need to have Java installed.

Double-click on it, MPC Maid must show. 

View the PDF documentation [here](https://github.com/cyriux/mpcmaid/blob/master/MpcMaid/documentation/MPCMaid_UserManual.pdf), or download it [here](https://github.com/cyriux/mpcmaid/raw/master/MpcMaid/documentation/MPCMaid_UserManual.pdf)


# Requirements

In Windows, if Winzip or Winrar tries to decompress the file this probably means you do not have Java installed yet. Go to http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp and download the JRE (1.6 update 12 at the time of writing) then follow the very simple instructions. In 2mn you can be done. 


# 

MPC Maid is offered for free for everyone so that you can get the best out of your MPC. You can use it forever without any limitation. If you feel like supporting this project then you can send feedback, contribute to the code and testing, and you can also donate what you want.

## Inspiration

MPC Maid is strongly inspired by the excellent [MPC Pad 187](http://mybunnyhug.com) by Stephen Norum, that is unfortunately not portable on other OS'es than Mac OS X.

## MPC1000 File Format

Based on the [extensive documentation](http://mybunnyhug.com/fileformats/pgm/) provided by Stephen Norum:

## Automatic Slicing

Beat detection follows the excellent guide ["Beat Detection Algorithms"](http://www.gamedev.net/reference/programming/features/beatdetection/) from Frédéric Patin:
